# CsGrafeq
A WinForm control that supports implicit function drawing
CsGrafeq is a powerful drawing application for drawing implicit functions with 2 variables.
It's an alternative to Grafeq.
CsGrafeq is partially based on Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables by Jeff Tupper of University of Toronto, SIGGRAPH 2001.
