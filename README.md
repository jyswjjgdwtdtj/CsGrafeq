## Description

CsGrafeq is a geometry sketchpad. It's made by Avalonia and use Material.Avalonia as its theme. 

For the sake that JIT is unavailable in mobile platforms and browser, CsGrafeq now only support Desktop (now only Windows). 

[Project](./OldVersion/README.md) in old version folder is for stably implicit function plotting. Implicit function plotting is being made now.

## Features

- ReadyToRun compiled, no .Net Runtime environment required.
- High quality function image plotting.
- Beautiful UI

## Project Structure

```
CsGrafeq.sln
├─ CsGrafeqApplication (Application layer: Avalonia UI + multi-platform hosts)
│  ├─ CsGrafeqApplication: Main UI/feature assembly; aggregates core libs and UI resources (assets, controls, resource dictionaries)
│  ├─ CsGrafeqApplication.Core: Reusable UI controls and core interaction components (keyboard, markdown, shared controls) for the app/dialogs
│  ├─ CsGrafeqApplication.Dialogs: Dialog/message box module (View/ViewModel split), depends on Core + MVVM
│  ├─ CsGrafeqApplication.Desktop: Desktop host/entry point (Win/macOS/Linux packaging; WinExe)
│  ├─ CsGrafeqApplication.Android: Android host (net10.0-android)
│  ├─ CsGrafeqApplication.iOS: iOS host (net10.0-ios)
│  └─ CsGrafeqApplication.Browser: WebAssembly/browser host (net10.0-browser)
└─ CsGrafeq (Core libraries: algorithms, numeric, compiler, shared infrastructure)
   ├─ CsGrafeq.Base: Shared base infrastructure & common types/utilities (also brings core Avalonia/ReactiveUI dependencies)
   ├─ CsGrafeq.Numeric: Numeric + symbolic math utilities/wrappers (e.g., MathNet.Symbolics), foundation for compiler/interval computations
   ├─ CsGrafeq.Compiler: Expression/formula compilation & evaluation (symbolic + expression compiler), used by Interval/Shapes/App
   ├─ CsGrafeq.Interval: Interval arithmetic and interval set types (Interval/IntervalSet) + compiler integration for implicit equations
   ├─ CsGrafeq.Shapes: Shape/geometry models and related logic (depends on Interval/Compiler/Numeric/I18N, etc.)
   ├─ CsGrafeq.MVVM: MVVM support library (ReactiveUI-based shared ViewModel infrastructure), depends on I18N
   ├─ CsGrafeq.I18N: Internationalization/localization resources + binding support (configuration binding generator enabled)
   ├─ CsGrafeq.I18N.Generator: Roslyn source generator/analyzer for I18N (wired into I18N as an Analyzer)
   ├─ CsGrafeq.Windows: Windows-specific adaptation (Avalonia.Win32 and related platform glue)
   ├─ CsGrafeq.Debug: Debug/diagnostics helpers (Avalonia.Diagnostics, etc.) for development-time tooling
   └─ CsGrafeq.Keyboard: Keyboard-related shared library (key definitions/input helpers), used by Core/App

```

## Future and Plan

### Short term plan

- Add text block supports
- Implement custom msgbox/inputbox
- Implement symbolic calculation (e.g. 0.5->1/2, 1.414->√2)
- Implement custom formula editor

### Long term plan

- Add more shapes supports
- Fix bugs

Welcome to any programming enthusiasts who wish to collaborate on development. 

You can put forward your opinions and suggestions in [Issues](https://github.com/jyswjjgdwtdtj/CsGrafeq/issues), I will
reply as soon as possible. 

Due to the pressure of high school academic studies, I will engage in development during the winter and summer holidays.
Each of your stars🌟 is the motivation for my development. Thank you🙏😊.
