# CsGrafeq
A WinForm control that supports implicit function drawing

CsGrafeq is a powerful drawing application for drawing implicit functions with 2 variables.

It's an alternative to Grafeq.

CsGrafeq is partially based on Reliable Two-Dimensional Graphing Methods for Mathematical Formulae with Two Free Variables by Jeff Tupper of University of Toronto, SIGGRAPH 2001.

CsGrafeq uses Microsoft.WindowsAPICodePack.DirectX to render images on the screen, so it can be easily replaced with Sharpdx.
